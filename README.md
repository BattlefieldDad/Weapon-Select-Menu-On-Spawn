# Weapon-Select-Menu-On-Spawn
Got asked for something similar a few times so thought I would make one. This is a simple weapon selection menu that works when you spawn in. When you spawn you can quickly skip the menu and play with the weapon selected via the menu, or you can use the menu system to select primary,secondary and throwables from any era.
